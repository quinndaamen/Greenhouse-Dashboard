# Smart Dashboard

A real-time dashboard project focused on integrating IT into greenhouse environments.
This was my first project combining hardware, backend, and frontend development — linking Arduino sensors to a Flask-based web dashboard.

---

### Project Context
- Goal: Learn by creating an IT solution that monitors greenhouse data and visualizes it through a web interface.
- Duration: 4 weeks
- Key learning areas: Python (Flask), Arduino integration, SQL basics, and frontend design (HTML/CSS).

---

### Prototype
- The initial prototype and interface design were created in Figma.

### Concepts
- Displays real-time temperature, humidity, and light data from sensors.
- Calculates a “plant health score” based on live conditions and the user's input.
- Simple, minimal web interface that updates automatically.
- Focused on learning full-stack logic and data flow between hardware and web.

---

### Skills Learned
- Web development with Flask and Jinja templates.
- Connecting Arduino sensor data to a web backend.
- Database handling and structuring with MySQL.
- Frontend design using HTML and CSS.
- Planning and developing a full small-scale ICT project.

### Tech
Python | MySQL | Arduino | Flask | HTML | CSS 

---

### Code
- Arduino code: Collects sensor data (temperature, humidity, light).
- Flask app: Handles backend logic and routes data to the web dashboard.
- Templates: HTML pages dynamically updated with sensor readings.
- Database: Stores and retrieves recorded environmental data.
